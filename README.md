# exercise-with-vue

## Project Description
Internship various tasks in order to get familiar with Vue.js basics:

1. Create a child component, name it as you wish, which has two inputs (type text), on user change, display the first name and last name real time
2. Create a computed property which returns the fullname. display it
3. Each computed props has a getter and a setter. Use the computed getter function to return the fullname
4. Create a method which sets the name initials. In ex: John Doe -> J D . Display it
5. Try to achieve the same thing with computed set function
You can use a new key on data, called initials, and on change, set it to whatever it's the first name and last name first letters.
6. Watch when Name Initials is changing, Alert prevVal && nextVal
7. Create a method, which increments or decrements a value:
   * when the value has reached 10, show the "Congrats", message
   * when -1, show "Failure", message
